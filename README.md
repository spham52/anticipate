Anticipate is a device for the ADHD. For those that forget things as they leave the house. For those in need of reminding when they open a cookie jar, etc.

Using the Pico Pi W board in combination with a motion sensor, anticipate sends users notifications to their device from anywhere over the internet when motion is sensed.

Simply setup anticipate on the home wifi, add your device to the notification group and anticipate everything. Placing a setup anticipate up in a desired position will send a notification to devices of your choice when motion is detected.
